This was an alpha build for the demonstration deadline for the CS135 final project. Features were cut from the intended final project such as: an enemy AI, the ability to call emergency meetings, the ability to kill Crewmates as an Imposter, and the hand scanning task. Hopefully in the future, a better beta build can be made more functional, and enabled with online multiplayer.
